# HurricaneAddons

**HurricaneAddons** is a library filled with scripts made to extend the Hurricane VR Framework for Unity. This repo offers a variety of tools to help you create engaging VR experiences with added functionality. 
While this repository doesnâ€™t contain direct changes to framework core scripts, it includes add-on code for features such as footsteps, door controls, and more. These add-ons are designed to be simple to implement and easy to customize for different VR projects.

## Public Use

All scripts in this repository are free to use, modify, and integrate into your own projects without the need for credit. Feel free to treat this code as your own! The only request is that you do not falsely claim authorship of the original scripts. If you are asked about the origin of the code, please be honest.
